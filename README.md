Hola!
#
My second project is based on a quiz on a famous tv show called "Vampire Diaries".
#
It is a level based quiz and has 3 levels. User has to qualify all the three levels in order to win the quiz.
#
User has to score minimum 13 out of 15 to win the quiz and to be in the high scorers.
#
I have used Javascript, for loops, if else and data structures.
